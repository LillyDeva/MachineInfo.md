Unnecessary About Me: I am very excited and very nervous about this course. Despite it being my senior year, I feel like a novice. I know a couple of classmates to help me complete this course but I am unsure if this is enough. I have a lot on my plate this semester and hope to keep up, but I may be asking a lot of questions if I am unable to understand everything that is handed out. If there are any extra resources, groups, tutors, or suggestions you have, they are always appreciated. Thank you and have a great day! :)
